**How to use:**

1. Open the HTML file in your browser
2. Click "Upload Logo" and select your Logo.png
3. Click "Generate QR Code"
4. Download your branded, trackable QR code

**Tracking features included:**

1. Unique tracking ID for each QR (e.g., ?qr_id=QR-1234...)
2. Timestamp tracking
3. Ready for analytics integration

**For production tracking:**
Set up your backend to capture the qr_id parameter when users scan the QR code and visit your demo page. You can then track:

Number of scans
Scan locations/times
Conversion rates from QR to demo bookings

The QR code uses High error correction **(30%)** so it works perfectly even with your logo covering the center!
