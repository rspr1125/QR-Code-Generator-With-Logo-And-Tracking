**How to use:**

Open the HTML file in your browser
Click "Upload Logo" and select your Logo.png
Click "Generate QR Code"
Download your branded, trackable QR code

**Tracking features included:**

Unique tracking ID for each QR (e.g., ?qr_id=QR-1234...)
Timestamp tracking
Ready for analytics integration

For production tracking:
Set up your backend to capture the qr_id parameter when users scan the QR code and visit your demo page. You can then track:

Number of scans
Scan locations/times
Conversion rates from QR to demo bookings

The QR code uses High error correction (30%) so it works perfectly even with your logo covering the center!
